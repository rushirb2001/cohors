# Changelog

All notable changes to **cohors** are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Versioning policy

cohors is pre-1.0, so it follows the `0.MINOR.PATCH` convention:

- **MINOR** (`0.x.0`) — new features _and_ any breaking change (the public surface
  is still unstable before 1.0).
- **PATCH** (`0.x.y`) — backwards-compatible bug fixes and polish only.

Every release gets an entry below and an annotated git tag (`vX.Y.Z`) on the
release commit. The version in `Cargo.toml` (`[workspace.package]`) is the single
source of truth and is bumped in a dedicated `chore(release)` commit.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`cohors web` is the local fleet in the browser — the same tool as the TUI
  (v0.5 slice 2).** `cohors web --root ~/code` scans **that folder's repos** and
  shows the exact same view the TUI does: local worktree status, ahead/behind,
  stash, and *why each repo needs you* (the `assess` attention reasons), enriched
  with remote CI/PRs. The native server does the scan and serves `cohors-core`
  snapshots as JSON (`/api/repos`, `/api/detail`, `/api/meta`); the browser
  deserializes the same models and renders them through the same
  `compute_view`/`assess`/`SortMode` logic — so the web and the TUI agree by
  construction (ADR-042). The GitHub token stays on the server (it enriches
  there) and never reaches the page. With nothing to scan, it falls back to the
  **demo fleet**.
- **The web fleet table mirrors the TUI's columns** — Repo · Branch · Sync
  (↑ahead ↓behind) · Changes (staged/modified/untracked) · Stash · PRs · CI ·
  Last · **Status** (the primary attention reason, severity-coloured). Columns
  are kept **compact** so the whole row (Status included) fits without sideways
  scroll: the data columns are narrow, long branch names truncate (full name on
  hover), and **Last shows just the commit age** (its subject is in the detail).
  While the remote pass is still running, the PRs/CI cells of GitHub repos show a
  **braille dot-spinner** instead of a dash. The attention summary strip
  (`fleet_summary`), the filter, the **needs-attention** toggle, and the
  **attention / recent / name / sync** sorts all run `cohors-core` verbatim.
- **The web drill-in mirrors the TUI's `Enter` pane.** Selecting a repo fetches
  its detail on demand: every reason it wants attention, the local facts (Sync ·
  Changes · Stash · CI · PRs · Last), **recent commits**, the **working-tree**
  changes, and — when it's a GitHub remote — **open PRs**, **top contributors**,
  open issues, and the latest release, plus the remote source link. Each section
  is best-effort; a dots spinner shows while it loads.
- **`cohors web --watch` keeps the page live.** With `--watch`, the dashboard
  polls for a fresh scan so edits, commits, and pulls show up without a manual
  rescan (re-scanning is cheap; remote stays server-cached). The header shows
  which folder is being scanned.

### Changed

- **The web fleet table is now icon-forward and tighter.** The terminal's cryptic
  `·`/`—` are gone, replaced by a small, color-coded SVG icon set (GitHub-style,
  not emoji): a **cloud-check** for in-sync / **cloud-slash** for a local-only
  branch (or `↑↓` arrows when diverged); a **pencil + count** for uncommitted
  changes; a **box + count** for stashes; a **pull-request icon + count** for open
  PRs; and a per-state **Status** icon (pencil / arrows / box / branch / alert).
  CI stays as **text** ("passing" / "failing", a braille **dot-spinner** +
  "pending" for a running build). The **Repo and Branch columns are fused** into
  one `name @branch` cell, and long names/branches truncate with the full text on
  hover — so every row fits on one line without sideways scroll. Every glyph has a
  tooltip.
- **The web app has a typeface now** — **Google Sans** (UI) and **Google Sans
  Code** (the data table / monospace), with **IBM Plex Sans** / **IBM Plex Mono**
  as the next fallback. They're loaded from the **Google Fonts CDN** (a `<link>`
  in `index.html`), so distribution stays a single static bundle with no font
  files to ship; the family stacks fall back to system fonts when offline.
- **`cohors web` now takes `--root` (and the other global flags).** It builds its
  view from the same `Scanner` the TUI/CLI/MCP use, so `--root`, `--config`, and
  `--watch` all apply. It still builds the web app from source (run it from the
  cohors checkout); a hosted, GitHub-account version is a later slice.
- **`cohors-core`'s `RepoDetail`/`ChangedFile` are now (de)serializable**, so the
  local drill-in can ship from the server to the browser unchanged.

## [0.4.21] — 2026-06-16

### Changed

- **`cohors web` is distribution-aware about Trunk.** Trunk is a *developer*
  dependency (it builds the WASM and runs the dev server), not something every
  install must ship: `cohors web` auto-installs it via Cargo when missing, and if
  Cargo isn't present (a prebuilt-binary, non-Rust install) it points at
  `brew install trunk` instead of failing obscurely. End users won't need Trunk
  at all — once the dashboard is deployed (v0.5 slice 4), an installed
  `cohors web` outside a checkout will open the hosted URL (no local build).

## [0.4.20] — 2026-06-16

### Added

- **`cohors-web` — the web front-end begins (v0.5, slice 1).** A new WASM crate
  renders the fleet in the browser with [Leptos](https://leptos.dev), reusing
  `cohors-core` *verbatim* — the same `resolve`/sort, `assess`/attention, and
  relative-time logic the TUI runs (ADR-002 / ADR-041). Slice 1 shows the
  built-in demo fleet (the browser analog of `cohors demo`); GitHub data, OAuth,
  and deployment follow in later slices. The crate is excluded from the native
  workspace and built only for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
- **`cohors web` — one command to launch the dashboard.** It finds the
  `cohors-web` crate, makes sure Trunk (the WASM bundler) is installed (installing
  it for you the first time, unless `--no-install`), starts the dev server, waits
  until it's actually listening, then opens a clean **branded local URL** —
  `http://cohors.localhost:8080` (the reserved-loopback `*.localhost` TLD, so no
  `/etc/hosts` edit and no privileges). `--port`, `--no-open`, `--no-install`.
  Run it from inside the repository (Trunk builds the app from source).

## [0.4.19] — 2026-06-16

### Changed

- **Help overlay collapses to its content** (capped at 90% of the screen) instead
  of a fixed tall box with trailing whitespace.

### Fixed

- **Help legend matches the actual row colours.** It claimed a *red* name meant
  "needs attention"; red is now reserved for unreadable (`error`) repos. The
  legend now reads: dim name = clean, bold name = needs attention, red name =
  unreadable.

## [0.4.18] — 2026-06-16

### Changed

- **The full detail view (`Enter`) collapses to its content and the commits pane
  gets a scrollbar.** It was a fixed 84%-height modal, so a repo with little to
  show left acres of whitespace, and the commits pane truncated with a "↓ N more"
  instead of scrolling. The modal now sizes to the taller pane's content (capped
  at 84% of the screen), and both panes scroll — each with a scrollbar that
  appears only when it overflows — sharing one scroll position, each clamped to
  its own length.

## [0.4.17] — 2026-06-16

### Changed

- **The context pane now lives inside the Repositories box** instead of being a
  separate box below it. The panel reserves its bottom rows for a titled divider
  rule (repo name·branch on the left, `Enter: full detail` on the right) and the
  selected repo's facts, with the table laid out above — one border around both.
  On short terminals it doesn't appear and the table uses the whole box.

## [0.4.16] — 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- **CI status is now accurate for GitHub Actions repos (ADR-040).** It was read
  only from the legacy commit Status API, which returns "pending" for repos that
  post no commit statuses — i.e. every Actions-only repo, forever (and the wrong
  value was cached across restarts). CI is now derived from the **Checks API**
  (where Actions report) combined with commit statuses: failing wins, then
  pending, then passing; with no checks *and* no statuses it's "no CI" — a real,
  distinct state, not a false pending. It self-corrects on the next scan/`--watch`
  refresh.

### Changed

- **Context pane: collapses to content, purple labels, top padding (ADR-039).**
  The pane no longer reserves a fixed height with trailing blank rows — it sizes
  to its content. Field labels (`Changes`, `Stash`, …) are now brand-purple, and
  there's a blank padding row above the first fact.

## [0.4.15] — 2026-06-16

### Changed

- **The context pane now word-wraps the last commit message** across the lines
  left in the pane (continuation lines indented under the value column) instead
  of truncating it with an ellipsis. If it's still longer than the pane, the last
  visible line ends with `…`. The pane is one row taller to give the message room.

## [0.4.14] — 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- **The context pane now stays on your repo across a `--watch` re-scan.** The
  cursor was anchored to a row *index*, so when a re-scan re-sorted the fleet
  (e.g. a repo you pushed went from "ahead" to clean and dropped down the
  dirty-first list) the cursor — and the detail dock — ended up pointing at a
  different repo, making the pane look like it hadn't updated. The cursor is now
  keyed to the selected repo's id and restored to its new position after every
  re-scan, so the pane keeps following the repo you were on (matching how the
  marked selection and busy set already survive re-sorts).

## [0.4.13] — 2026-06-16

### Changed

- **Redesigned the context pane as a labeled form (ADR-039 follow-up).** The dock
  was an unreadable mix of a bulleted reason list and a cryptic `changes 3 s1
  sync ●` line that restated it. It's now a small, scannable form — one dim,
  fixed-width label per fact, everything spelled out (no `s1`/`●`), color for
  urgency:

  ```
  Changes      3 modified · 1 untracked
  Stash        1 · stale
  Upstream     2 ahead  (origin/main)
  Remote       CI passing  ·  2 open PRs
  Last commit  2h ago — fix: retry on 5xx
  ```

  Changes now shows the staged/modified/untracked breakdown (which the table's
  count hides), and the full commit message lives here (the row no longer shows
  it). No more duplication between the pane and the row.

## [0.4.12] — 2026-06-16

### Changed

- **Expanded, edge-to-edge table columns when the dock is up (ADR-039
  follow-up).** The reclaimed width now goes to legible, separate columns instead
  of compact fused glyphs: the old `Sync` (`↑2 ● 2pr`) splits into **Sync**
  (ahead/behind), **PRs** (open count), and **CI** (spelled out:
  `passing`/`failing`/`pending`); the old `Changes` (`4 s1`) splits into
  **Changes** and **Stash**. The reason column is renamed **Status**, and the
  table fills the full width. Short terminals keep the compact layout.

## [0.4.11] — 2026-06-16

### Changed

- **The repository table stops repeating the commit message when the dock shows
  it (ADR-039 follow-up).** With the dock up, the trailing column splits into
  **Last** (commit age) and **Why** — the repo's primary attention reason,
  colored by severity (`↑2 unpushed`, `↓5 behind — pull`, …) — so the
  dirty-first ordering is now self-explaining on every row, not just the selected
  one. On short terminals (no dock) the full "Last commit" column is kept, so no
  information is lost.

## [0.4.10] — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Docked context pane — the dashboard is now a cockpit (ADR-039).** On a tall
  terminal, a pane appears below the list and follows the cursor: idle, it shows
  the selected repo at a glance — why it wants attention (the reasons that drive
  the sort), its changes/sync, and the last commit; during a bulk action, it
  shows the in-flight repos with spinners. It reads only the data already
  scanned (no extra I/O); the full PRs/commits/contributors view still lives
  behind `Enter`. On short terminals it simply doesn't appear and the list takes
  the whole area.

### Changed

- **Commit messages ellipsize** (`…`) to the column width instead of being
  hard-cut at the frame edge.
- **A repo's name is no longer coloured red just for wanting attention** — red
  is reserved for genuinely broken (`error`) repos. This also removes the red
  block that appeared when an aging-unpushed repo was the selected (highlighted)
  row.

## [0.4.9] — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **`commit` and `push` actions across every surface (ADR-038).** A new
  `commit` action stages tracked + untracked changes (`git add -A`) and commits
  them with a message ("nothing to commit" is a no-op; never amends). It joins
  `push` so the full **edit → commit → push** loop is available to your agent
  and your scripts, not just the TUI.
  - **MCP:** new `push` tool (needs `--allow-writes`) and `commit` tool (needs
    `--allow-writes` + `confirm:true` + a `message`), both with `dry_run`
    previews. The agent can now finish a cross-repo change end-to-end.
  - **CLI:** actions are now first-class subcommands —
    `cohors fetch|pull|push|commit|stash|run` — each taking the same `--select`
    selector language as `scan --select`, plus `--dry-run`. `commit` takes
    `--message`; `run` takes a command and `--timeout`. A selector is required,
    so an action never silently hits the whole fleet (pass `--select all`).

### Safety

- The CLI has no capability flags by design — the human running the command is
  the consent, like `git push` itself. The agent-facing MCP server keeps the
  full ADR-025 tiering. On every surface the shared action layer holds the same
  guarantees: `pull` is fast-forward-only, `push` never force-pushes, and
  `commit`/`stash` cannot lose work.

## [0.4.8] — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Open-issue count + latest release in detail (ADR-037).** The detail pane's
  left column now leads its GitHub section with a one-line summary —
  `N open issues  ·  latest vX` — fetched alongside the PRs and contributors.

### Changed

- **MCP `get_repo` returns the same remote detail as the TUI (ADR-037).**
  Inspecting one repo is now consistent across surfaces: `get_repo` carries a
  `remote_detail` field (open PRs, contributors, open-issue count, latest
  release) via the same `cohors_github::fetch_repo_detail` the `Enter` pane uses,
  when the repo has a remote and a token. The fleet-wide `list_prs` rollup is
  unchanged — it answers a different (cross-repo triage) question. The control
  surfaces remain CLI, TUI, and MCP, all sharing one `cohors-core` model and one
  fetch path.

## [0.4.7] — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Richer two-pane detail pane (ADR-036).** Pressing `Enter` on a repo now shows
  a standup-style split: the left column has changes, branches, stashes, **open
  pull requests, and top contributors**; the right column has recent commits. PRs
  and contributors are fetched from GitHub on demand (when the repo has a remote
  and a token), shown with a `loading…` / `needs a GitHub remote + token` state
  so an empty section never reads as broken. New `cohors-core` models
  (`PullRequest`, `Contributor`, `RemoteDetail`) + `cohors_github::fetch_repo_detail`.

## [0.4.6] — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Interactive first-run rescue (ADR-035).** When the dashboard finds no repos
  under your configured roots, the empty state now detects repos elsewhere and
  offers `[u] use these · [q] quit` — pressing `u` writes those roots to your
  config and rescans live, no restart. It's a confirmed `init`: detect → show →
  write only on a keypress, never silently. (`cohors scan` keeps its clean
  stdout + stderr hint; the picker lives only in the interactive launch.)

## [0.4.5] — 2026-06-15

### Changed

- **`cohors scan` no longer goes silent on an empty fleet.** stdout stays a clean
  `[]` (the scriptable JSON contract is untouched), but a one-line hint now goes
  to **stderr** — "no git repositories found under …; run `cohors init` or pass
  --root" — so a human isn't left guessing while pipelines ignore it.
- The TUI empty state notes that `cohors init` auto-detects your repos.

## [0.4.4] — 2026-06-15

### Changed

- **`run` fans out concurrently (ADR-034).** The MCP `run` tool now executes
  across its target repos over a bounded thread pool (8), instead of one at a
  time — a fleet-wide command finishes in about the slowest repo's time, not the
  sum. Results stay in target order; per-repo timeouts are unchanged. This closes
  the v0.4 MCP hardening backlog.

## [0.4.3] — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **MCP action guardrails (ADR-033), via a new `[mcp]` config table.**
  - `max_action_targets` (default 50): an action whose selector resolves to more
    repos than the cap is refused unless the selector is an explicit
    `{all: true}` — a fumbled broad selector can't fan out. `0` disables it.
  - `run_allowlist` (default empty = any): restricts `run` to commands matching
    `*`-glob patterns (e.g. `"cargo *"`, `"git *"`).
  - **Audit log**: every executed action writes `{tool, selector, resolved_ids,
    ok/failed}` to `cohors.log`.

### Fixed

- CI: bumped `actions/checkout` to v5 (v4's Node 20 runtime is deprecated).

## [0.4.2] — 2026-06-15

### Changed

- **Auto-detected discovery, consistent across CLI/TUI/MCP (ADR-032).** With no
  configured roots, cohors probes common code directories (`~/code`,
  `~/projects`, `~/dev`, `~/src`, `~/work`, `~/Developer`, …) and the working
  directory (using its parent when you're inside a repo) to find where your repos
  live — so a zero-config run shows a populated fleet everywhere, not an empty
  one. Resolution: `--root` → config `roots` → auto-detected → current directory.
- **`cohors init` seeds real roots.** It now writes the detected roots into the
  config (and reports them) instead of the blind `~/projects` placeholder.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-06-15

### Changed

- **Remote tools now report what they dropped.** `list_prs` / `ci_status` add
  `meta.excluded` (and a note) for selected repos that have no GitHub remote, so
  an agent can reconcile "18 repos but 14 CI rows" instead of guessing.
- **Fixed stale tool descriptions.** `fetch`/`pull`/`stash`/`run` now correctly
  state that `dry_run` previews need neither the tier flag nor `confirm`, and
  `run` documents the enforced `timeout_secs` (no longer claims it's unenforced).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-15

**Milestone: the agent surface.** `cohors mcp` exposes the fleet to a coding
agent over the Model Context Protocol — the same core the dashboard uses. This
release marks the v0.4 milestone, delivered incrementally across 0.3.58–0.3.63:

- **Selectors** — a serializable fleet predicate with a pure `resolve()` shared
  by the CLI (`scan --select`), the TUI, and MCP (ADR-024).
- **`cohors mcp` stdio server** — hand-rolled sync JSON-RPC, no new dependency
  (ADR-028). Read tools `list_repos`, `get_repo`, `fleet_summary`, `repo_path`,
  `search`, `list_prs`, `ci_status`; results in the `cohors scan` shape plus a
  per-repo `assessment` and a top-level `fleet`.
- **Cross-fleet `search`** — content (ripgrep → git grep → in-process fallback)
  and metadata (path/name/branch), selector-scoped.
- **Action tools** `fetch`, `pull` (ff-only), `stash`, `run` behind the ADR-025
  safety tiers — read-only by default, `--allow-writes`/`--allow-run`, per-call
  `confirm`, side-effect-free `dry_run`, and a `run` timeout.
- **Fail-loud reads** — every read carries `roots`/`config_path`/`total`/
  `errored` and a `note`, and discovery falls back to the current directory, so
  an empty fleet explains itself instead of looking "all clear" (ADR-029).

No code changes since 0.3.63 — this is the version marker for the completed
milestone.

## [0.3.63] — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Remote MCP read tools `list_prs` and `ci_status`** (ADR-031), GitHub-enriched
  on demand. With no token they return an empty set plus a `meta.note` saying so.
  The read surface is now complete: `list_repos`, `get_repo`, `fleet_summary`,
  `search`, `repo_path`, `list_prs`, `ci_status`.

### Changed

- **`dry_run` is now side-effect-free in the truest sense** — it previews the
  target set *before* any tier/`confirm` gate, so an agent can preview on a
  read-only server and a human can approve before enabling writes/run. (Fixes the
  `dry_run`-required-`confirm` contradiction.)
- **`run` enforces a per-repo timeout** (`timeout_secs`, default 120s): a hung
  command is killed and reported as `timed_out` instead of stalling the fan-out.

## [0.3.62] — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **MCP action tools (ADR-030): `fetch`, `pull` (ff-only), `stash`, `run`.** The
  agent surface is now a control plane, not just a reader. Safety per ADR-025:
  read-only by default; `fetch`/`pull` need `--allow-writes`; `stash` adds
  `confirm: true`; `run` (arbitrary shell, per-repo `{exit_code, stdout, stderr,
  truncated}` + a monotonic `run_id`) needs `--allow-run` + `confirm: true`.
  Every action takes a required selector (empty matches nothing — never the whole
  fleet), excludes error/path-less repos, and supports `dry_run` to preview the
  exact target set with no side effects. Permission errors state the fix (e.g.
  "relaunch with `cohors mcp --allow-writes`").

### Deferred

- For `run`: bounded-pool parallelism and `timeout_secs` enforcement (currently
  sequential; the arg is accepted but not yet enforced), plus the config-driven
  `max_action_targets` cap, `run_allowlist`, and audit log.

## [0.3.61] — 2026-06-15

### Changed

- **Zero-config discovery (ADR-029).** With no `roots` configured, cohors now
  scans the current directory (like ripgrep/lazygit) instead of showing an empty
  fleet. Resolution order: `--root` → config `roots` → current directory.

### Added

- **Fail-loud MCP reads.** `list_repos`, `fleet_summary`, and `search` now attach
  a `meta` block — `roots`, `config_path`, `total`, `errored`, and a plain
  `note` when the result is empty or partial — so an agent never mistakes a
  misconfigured root (`total: 0`) for "all clear."

## [0.3.60] — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Cross-fleet `search`, exposed as an MCP tool.** `kind=content` greps file
  contents across the selected repos (ripgrep → `git grep` → an in-process
  `ignore`-walk fallback, fixed-string match, so there's no hard external
  dependency); `kind=path`/`name`/`branch` match snapshot metadata. Results are
  selector-scoped and capped (`max_results`), with a `truncated` flag. This is
  the agent's entry point for cross-repo refactors.
- Metadata search (`search_metadata`, path/name/branch) lives in the pure,
  WASM-safe `cohors-core`; content search (`search_content`) lives in the
  `cohors-git` adapter where the file I/O belongs.

## [0.3.59] — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **`cohors mcp` — a Model Context Protocol server over stdio** (ADR-028), so a
  coding agent can see your fleet with the same logic the dashboard uses.
  Read-only in this slice, with the core read tools: `list_repos` (selector /
  sort / fields / limit), `get_repo`, `fleet_summary`, and `repo_path`. Each repo
  is returned in the `cohors scan` shape plus a per-repo `assessment` (severity +
  needs-attention) and a top-level `fleet` summary. Register it with
  `claude mcp add cohors -- cohors mcp`. The `--allow-writes` / `--allow-run` /
  `--allow-open` flags are accepted for the forthcoming action tools.

### Note

- The MCP transport is a hand-rolled synchronous JSON-RPC loop (no `tokio`,
  no new dependency), keeping the binary on its sync architecture; `rmcp`
  remains an isolated future swap (ADR-028 revises ADR-023).

## [0.3.58] — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **`Selector` + pure `resolve()` in `cohors-core` (ADR-024).** A serializable
  predicate over the fleet — identity/scope, local state, remote, and `any_of`/
  `not` combinators — that resolves to an ordered `Vec<RepoId>`. The empty
  selector resolves to nothing (never "all"), so an action can't target the whole
  fleet by omission. Pure and WASM-safe.
- **`cohors scan --select <query>`.** Filter the JSON to a subset using the same
  resolver, via JSON (`'{"behind":true}'`) or shorthand (`dirty`, `behind`,
  `ahead`, `attention`, `clean`, `name:pay*`, `ci:failing`, `prs:1`, comma-separated
  to AND them). `cohors scan --select behind` and a future MCP `list_repos` share
  one resolver, so they return identical sets.

## [0.3.57] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- **New spider mark** — a two-tone design with a solid eyed body and shaded
  (`▒`) outer legs, giving it depth and a bit of personality.
- **The header packs to the left.** The brand block, divider, and info column are
  now sized to their content and grouped together instead of the info column
  floating against the right edge, removing the empty gap mid-line.
- **Compact header for narrow terminals.** When the window is too narrow to hold
  the taglines and info column, the header collapses to the spider, the `cohors`
  lede, and the watched directory — nothing else.

### Changed

- **The spider's legs are now half-block diagonals.** Four legs reach out from a
  small `▟█▙` body as solid `▀▄`/`▄▀` diagonals, for a cleaner, leggier spider
  than the corner-quadrant version.

## [0.3.55] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- **The spider mark is leggier and less "droid".** The body shrank from a
  three-row block with two eyes to a single compact row, and eight quadrant-block
  legs now splay to the corners — reading as a spider rather than a robot head.

## [0.3.54] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- **The header info column now shows session orientation instead of fleet counts**
  (which already live in the Attention panel right below). The three rows are the
  watched directory, the active config path, and the fleet's most recent commit
  (`active 2h ago`) — context that isn't shown anywhere else.
- Dropped the trailing em-dash from the header tagline.

## [0.3.53] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- **The spider mark is now a true purple** (`#A855F7`) instead of the terminal's
  pinkish ANSI magenta, and the `cohors` wordmark matches it.
- **The header gained a right-hand info column.** A full-height divider splits the
  brand block from a one-glance summary: the watched directory (home-abbreviated),
  the repo / dirty counts, and a needs-attention / all-clear status line.

## [0.3.52] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- **The header mark is now a pixel-art spider** instead of the shield — a chunky
  block-glyph body with two eyes and splayed legs, evoking a spider at the centre
  of its web (every repo a thread it holds). It renders in the app's purple
  (`Color::Magenta`) and stays `NO_COLOR`-safe: the eyes are gaps and the body is
  solid blocks, so the silhouette reads even without colour.

## [0.3.51] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- **The header is now a logo lockup** — a shield mark built from block glyphs
  (`▟█▙ / ▜█▛ / ▀`) beside the `cohors` wordmark, version, and tagline. The box
  grew to five rows to hold it; the mark renders in the accent colour and is
  `NO_COLOR`-safe (no emoji, all monospace-stable glyphs).

## [0.3.50] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- **The command-run view now matches the standup view's structure.** Its repo
  list and output are each wrapped in a titled box (`Repos` and the focused
  repo's name), with the same padding and a clean (cap-less) scrollbar — the two
  "list + detail" overlays were previously inconsistent (one boxed, one bare).

## [0.3.49] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- **Shell mode (opening the palette with `!`) is now visually distinct.** The box
  title becomes " Shell command ", the border, prompt, and row switch to the
  warning accent, and the cheat sheet **collapses to just the highlighted `:!<cmd>`
  row** (with a `▌` marker) — so it's clear you're about to run a shell command,
  not a built-in verb.

## [0.3.48] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- **Unified the two command surfaces into one.** The separate `!` "Run command"
  modal is gone; pressing `!` now just opens the single `:` command palette
  pre-seeded with `!` (the shell shortcut). One command line drives built-in
  verbs *and* shell.
- **Redesigned the palette as a proper two-column table** — a `:` prompt, a
  horizontal divider, then `command │ description` rows separated by a vertical
  divider (verbs in accent, descriptions dim). Much clearer than the previous
  flat hint rows.

### Removed

- The `CommandInput` mode and its modal (folded into the `:` palette).

## [0.3.47] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- Both command modals now carry a **structured, colour-coded cheat sheet inside
  the box** instead of dumping hints on the footer. The `:` palette groups verbs
  by `act` / `shell` / `view` / `go` (verbs in accent, descriptions dim,
  placeholders shown), and the `!` runner explains what it does with example
  commands. Their footers are slimmed to just `⏎ run · Esc cancel`.

## [0.3.46] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- The `:` command palette now renders as a **centered boxed overlay** (a
  " Command " box with a `:` prompt over the dimmed dashboard), matching the `!`
  command-runner's design, instead of a bare line in the top strip. The two
  command surfaces now look consistent.

## [0.3.45] — 2026-06-14

### Added

- **`:!<cmd>` runs a shell command across the target repos from the command line**
  — folding the `!` runner into the `:` palette, so one command line drives both
  cohors's built-in verbs and arbitrary shell. (`!` stays as the quick shortcut.)
  Groundwork toward a single selector-targeted command surface shared with the
  planned CLI `--select` and MCP.

## [0.3.44] — 2026-06-14

Tier 4: watch mode.

### Added

- **`cohors --watch`** keeps the dashboard live: it re-scans automatically every
  ~5 seconds while idle (not during a scan, an in-flight action, a command run,
  or while you're in an overlay/command line), so the board stays current
  hands-free.

## [0.3.43] — 2026-06-14

Tier 3: command mode.

### Added

- **A `:` command mode** (vim/k9s-style). Press `:` to get a command line, then:
  `:fetch` / `:pull` / `:push`, `:refresh`, `:standup`, `:sort name|dirty|recent`,
  `:dirty`, `:filter <text>` (or `/<text>`), `:help`, `:quit`, or a bare repo name
  to jump the cursor to it. Reuses the same handlers as the keybindings, so every
  verb behaves identically to its key. Unknown input shows an "unknown command"
  toast.

## [0.3.42] — 2026-06-14

Tier 2: a repo detail pane — inspect before you act.

### Added

- **`Enter` now opens a per-repo detail pane** (read-only, scrollable) showing
  the repo's recent commits (with colour-coded types), working-tree changes (with
  porcelain status), local branches (current marked), and stashes. Data is read
  off-thread, so the pane shows a brief "Reading repo…" state and never blocks the
  UI; `cohors demo` seeds it with sample data. New pure `cohors_core::RepoDetail`
  model + `cohors_git::repo_detail()` adapter. See ADR-027.
- **Groundwork for command mode (`:`)**: a pure, unit-tested command parser
  (`crate::command`) mapping `:fetch`/`:sort name`/`/wip`/`<repo>` etc. to typed
  actions — wired into a `:` input in a later release.

### Changed

- **`Enter` no longer opens the editor** (it opens the detail pane); the editor
  is reached via the **`o` "Open with…" picker**. Supersedes the `Enter` binding
  from 0.3.21.

## [0.3.41] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- Made the two repo-list overflow hints consistent: both now read `{arrow} N
  more` (`↑ N more` / `↓ N more`), instead of the bottom one using a different
  `… N more ↓` form.

## [0.3.40] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- The repo list now shows **both overflow hints at once** when repos are hidden
  above *and* below the visible window — `↑ N more` below the header and
  `… N more ↓` at the bottom — instead of only one. At the very top or bottom it
  still shows just the relevant one.

## [0.3.39] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- Removed the **blank line between the repository column headers and the rows**
  (the header no longer carries a bottom margin).
- The `↑ N more` overflow hint (shown when scrolled to the end) now sits **just
  below the column headers** rather than above them, so the headers always stay
  at the top. The header is rendered as its own row to make room for it.

## [0.3.38] — 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- The repo list's overflow hint now sits on the correct side: `… N more ↓` at the
  **bottom** while repos remain below, and `↑ N more` at the **top** once you've
  scrolled to the end (the hidden repos are then above). Previously the `↑ N more`
  was wrongly shown at the bottom.

## [0.3.37] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- Added a blank gap row between the standup's description sentence and the panes,
  so the text has breathing room above the Repos/commits boxes.

## [0.3.36] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- The standup description is now a **flowing sentence** instead of a chip list:
  "You authored 130 commits this week across 5 repos, shipping 68 features,
  fixing 14 bugs, polishing 16 design changes, clearing 15 chores, and writing 8
  doc updates." Each commit type maps to a natural verb/noun clause, the nouns
  stay colour-coded by kind, and the sentence wraps.

## [0.3.35] — 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- The standup description no longer overflows. It's now a proper two-line block —
  a sentence (`You authored 129 commits this week across 5 repos`) above the
  colour-coded type breakdown (`68 feat · 16 design · 15 chore · …`) — and both
  **wrap** instead of clipping, with the breakdown capped at the top 6 types plus
  a `+N more`.

## [0.3.34] — 2026-06-14

### Added

- **Colour-coded commit types in the standup** — `feat` (green), `fix` (red),
  `design`/`style` (magenta), `chore`/`build`/`ci` (blue), `docs`/`content`
  (cyan), `refactor`/`perf` (yellow), unknown (dim). The colours appear both in
  the glance summary (`24 feat · 5 fix`) and on each commit's type prefix in the
  list, so the kind of work reads at a glance. Honours `NO_COLOR`.

## [0.3.33] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- **The standup commits pane now has a highlighted cursor.** Focusing it (`→`/
  `⏎`) highlights a commit and `↑/↓` move that highlight, with the list scrolling
  to keep it in view — so scrolling is contextual instead of a free offset.
- The commits pane title shows the **commit count** (`payments · 24 commits`).
- The description above the panes is now an **at-a-glance summary of what you
  did** — `You authored 29 commits this week — 24 feat · 5 fix` (top commit
  types) — rather than UI instructions.

### Fixed

- The standup **scrollbar** now tracks the cursor correctly (proportional thumb,
  accurate position), replacing the previous free-offset scroll that could drift
  out of sync.

## [0.3.32] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- The **standup view is shorter** — it's now sized to its content (the busiest
  repo's commit count, capped) and scrolls past that, instead of always taking
  86% of the screen and leaving a lot of empty space.
- Added a **dynamic description line above the two panes** — `Your commits <this
  week> · pick a repo (left) to read its commits (right)` — so the view explains
  what each column is and which window it covers.

## [0.3.31] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- Gave the footer hints **breathing room**: 1-column padding inside each group
  box and spacing around the vertical column divider, so commands no longer
  stick to the borders.

## [0.3.30] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- Added a **horizontal divider** inside each footer group box, separating the
  two-column hint grid from the full-width multi-word commands below it (edge to
  edge, touching the box borders).

## [0.3.29] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- **Footer group boxes now use a two-column grid with a `│` divider, with the
  multi-word commands stacked full-width below it.** Short hints (`open`,
  `fetch`, `pull`, `push`, `stash`; `move`, `sort`, `help`, `quit`; `filter`,
  `clear`, `mark all`) pack two-up; longer ones (`run command`, `mark repo`,
  `dirty-only`, `standup`) get their own full-width rows. Because the columns
  only ever hold short hints, they **stay two-up even on a compact terminal**
  (no more collapsing to one column), and there's no inner padding eating the
  width.

## [0.3.28] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- The action/scan toast now rides the **top-right of the Repositories box
  border** (e.g. `Repositories (5) · sort: dirty-first ──── ✓ pushed 3 repos`)
  instead of floating as a separate box — cleaner, no overlap with the footer.
  Still colored (green `✓` / red `✗` / dim spinner) and self-dismissing.

## [0.3.27] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- **Moved transient feedback out of the header into a self-dismissing toast.**
  Scan progress and action results (fetch/pull/push/stash/copy/…) now appear in a
  small floating box at the bottom-right, above the footer — green `✓` for a
  confirmation, red `✗` for a failure, a spinner while scanning. In-progress
  messages stay until the work finishes; results clear themselves after a few
  seconds. The header box is now purely the cohors name, version, and tagline.

## [0.3.26] — 2026-06-14

Tier 1 of the pro-grade push: closing the unpushed loop.

### Added

- **Push (`P`), single and bulk.** Pushes the current branch to its upstream
  across the marked repos (or the current one), with the same live per-repo
  status and aggregate summary as fetch/pull. It never passes `--force`, so a
  non-fast-forward push is rejected by git (reported as "rejected (pull first)")
  rather than overwriting remote history — resolving the #1 attention reason
  (unpushed) without leaving the dashboard.

## [0.3.25] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- The repo list's scroll hint now renders **on its own centered row inside the
  box** (bold accent) instead of on the bottom border, and shows `↑ N more` once
  you've scrolled to the bottom — so the affordance reads as content, not chrome.

## [0.3.24] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- The repo list's `… N more ↓` overflow hint is now **centered on the bottom
  border and rendered in bold accent** (was dim and right-aligned), so it's
  clearly visible instead of tucked into the corner.

## [0.3.23] — 2026-06-14

### Added

- **A scroll affordance on the repository list.** When the fleet is taller than
  the window, the list's bottom border shows a dim `… N more ↓` so it's obvious
  there are repos below the fold; it disappears once everything fits. The table's
  scroll offset is tracked so the count is accurate as you move.

### Notes

- Audited the TUI's glyphs against what renders reliably in terminals — `↑`/`↓`
  (Arrows block), `●` (Geometric Shapes), `▌` (Block Elements), the rounded box
  borders (Box Drawing), and `…` (U+2026) are all in the well-supported ranges,
  so the structure is stable across modern monospace fonts. No glyph changes
  needed; this was a deliberate check, not an assumption.

## [0.3.22] — 2026-06-14

### Added

- When the "Open with…" picker finds **no editor CLI on your `PATH`**, it now
  shows a short note ("No editor CLI found on your PATH. Install its shell
  command to list it here.") above the still-available Reveal / lazygit options,
  instead of silently listing only those.

## [0.3.21] — 2026-06-14

Opening a repo, done properly.

### Added

- **An "Open with…" picker (`o`)** that **auto-detects the editors installed on
  your `PATH`** — VS Code, Cursor, Zed, Sublime, JetBrains, Windsurf, then
  nvim/vim/helix/emacs/… — alongside "Reveal in file manager" and lazygit. Pick
  one with `↑/↓ · ⏎`, or press `d` to **set it as your default** (remembered
  across runs in a small prefs file, so your `config.toml` is left untouched).

### Changed

- **`Enter` now opens the default editor** (resolved from your saved pick →
  `editor`/`$EDITOR`/`$VISUAL` → the first detected editor). The **first time**
  you press it with no default set, it opens the picker so you choose once.
- **`o` is now "Open with…"** (reveal-in-folder moved inside the picker). The
  old dead-end "no editor configured" message is gone.

### Notes

- A modifier+Enter trigger (e.g. `Cmd`/`Ctrl`+`Enter`) was considered but isn't
  reliably deliverable to a terminal app, so the picker uses the dedicated `o`
  key instead. See ADR-026.

## [0.3.20] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- Moved the **sort mode into the Repositories box title** (`Repositories (18) ·
  sort: dirty-first`, plus `· dirty-only` when that filter is on) and **dropped
  the redundant repo count from the header** — the box title already carries it.
  The header's right side now shows only the live selection count and the
  transient status toast.

## [0.3.19] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- The Attention count moved into the **box title** — `Attention (13 of 18
  repositories)` — so the body is just the category pills. Removes the separate
  summary sentence entirely.

## [0.3.18] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- The **Attention** panel now reads on a single line — the category pills
  (`1 unpushed · 11 dirty · 2 stashed`) sit right after the summary's colon
  instead of wrapping to their own row, so the box is one row shorter.

## [0.3.17] — 2026-06-14

### Added

- **A hide/show toggle for the hint bar.** A divider line above the footer reads
  `── press h to hide hints ──`; pressing **`h`** collapses the three group boxes
  to just that line (now `── press h to unhide hints ──`), handing all the
  reclaimed rows to the repository list. Press `h` again to bring them back.

## [0.3.16] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- **Dropped the footer's outer box** — the three `select`/`act`/`view` boxes now
  sit directly in the footer area, reclaiming two rows and a little width.
- **The boxed footer is now the only Normal-mode layout** (the stacked-rows
  fallback is gone) and it adapts to the width itself: `act`/`view` use two
  internal columns when there's room and collapse to one on a compact terminal,
  so the keys are never clipped however narrow the window gets.

## [0.3.15] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- **The footer is now a box-of-boxes.** Instead of three stacked, wrapping rows,
  Normal mode shows one outer box holding three titled group boxes —
  **`select`**, **`act`**, **`view`** — side by side. The busier `act` and `view`
  groups lay their keys out in two internal columns (so no group runs more than a
  few rows), and the live action target rides the `act` box's bottom edge
  (`→ <repo>` / `→ N selected`). On a narrow terminal it falls back to the
  previous stacked-rows footer so the keys never get squeezed.

## [0.3.14] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- **Redesigned the `?` help into a single aligned grid.** The legend was a
  run-on paragraph that wrapped mid-phrase; it's now one short, non-wrapping
  `glyph → meaning` row per symbol, and the keymap shares the exact same
  two-column layout, so every description lines up in one column. The overlay is
  a touch wider with proper inner padding so it reads as a structured reference.

## [0.3.13] — 2026-06-14

Try cohors in five seconds.

### Added

- **`cohors demo`** — launches the dashboard on a built-in, privacy-safe sample
  fleet with **no config, no scanning, and no disk/network access**. Every column
  and view is populated (ahead/behind, dirty, stashed, CI pass/fail/pending, open
  PRs, a detached HEAD, an off-remote repo, an unreadable repo); the standup is
  seeded from demo commits and the command runner is simulated. Real actions are
  friendly no-ops. The generator lives in the pure core (`cohors_core::demo`) so
  the future web playground reuses the exact same data. See ADR-022.

## [0.3.12] — 2026-06-14

Making the dashboard explain itself.

### Added

- **A legend in the `?` help** that decodes the columns with their real colored
  glyphs: what `↑2`/`↓5`/`·`/`—` mean in Sync, the CI dot colors and `Npr`, the
  staged-vs-unstaged colors and `s1` in Changes, and what a dim vs red row (and
  the `●` marker) signify. New users no longer have to guess what they're seeing.
- **A live action-target hint** on the footer's `act` row: it now says exactly
  what an action will hit — `→ acts on 3 selected`, or `→ acts on <repo>` when
  nothing is marked — so the "marked set, else cursor" rule is visible, not
  inferred.

### Changed

- The footer's `view` row now surfaces **`s` sort** and **`d` dirty-only**, which
  were previously only discoverable inside the help overlay.
- Action feedback is now a **brighter, auto-clearing toast**: confirmations show
  green with a `✓`, failures show red, and the message clears itself a few
  seconds after the work finishes instead of lingering in the header.

## [0.3.11] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- The **Sync** and **Changes** columns are now sized to their actual content
  instead of a fixed width, so they stay tight. A fleet with no open PRs gets a
  narrow Sync column (just the dot/arrows) rather than always reserving room for
  a `● Npr`; the column grows only when some repo needs it (clamped to a sane
  max). Sync floors at its header width, Changes at `"Changes"` (7).

## [0.3.10] — 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- Tightened the fused **Sync** column: it was too wide (left a large empty gap
  before Changes) and showed a redundant `·` next to the remote dot for repos
  that are even with upstream (two tiny dots with a gap that read as wasted
  space). The `·` is now dropped whenever the remote dot is present, so an
  even, tracked repo shows just `●`, and the column is narrower.

## [0.3.9] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- **Sync and Remote columns fused into one `Sync` column.** It now shows the
  upstream delta and the remote health side-by-side — e.g. `↑2 ● 2pr` (2 ahead,
  CI passing, 2 open PRs), `↓5 ●` (5 behind), `· ●` (even), or `—` for a purely
  local repo. Five data columns become four, leaving more room for the commit
  subject while keeping all the signal.

### Added

- **Responsive two-pane overlays.** The standup and command-runner views now
  adapt to the terminal width: side-by-side (list + detail) when there's room,
  and **stacked** (list on top, detail below) on a narrow terminal, so neither
  pane gets squeezed. The command-runner also gains a small gap between its repo
  list and output for clarity.

## [0.3.7] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- **Repository table columns reworked for a more compact, aligned read.** The
  separate **Stash** column is gone — stash count is now folded into **Changes**
  as a dim `s{n}` suffix (e.g. `4 s1` = 4 changed files, 1 stash), freeing width
  for the commit subject.

### Fixed

- The **Repo** header now lines up with the repository names: it accounts for the
  two-column selection gutter (`●`/blank) that prefixes each name, instead of
  sitting two columns to its left.

## [0.3.6] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- The standup view now wraps each pane in its own padded, titled box ("Repos"
  and the focused repo name), with the active pane's title bold — more breathing
  room and clearer structure.

### Fixed

- The standup scrollbar now renders cleanly inside the commits box (proportional
  thumb, no stray arrows) instead of cramped against the outer border.
- You can read a repo's full commit history with arrow keys alone: `→`/`⏎` (or
  `Tab`) focuses the commits pane so `↑/↓` scroll them, `←` goes back — no
  PgUp/PgDn required.

### Changed

- The **standup** view now uses the command-runner's two-pane layout: a repo
  list with per-repo commit counts on the left, and the focused repo's commits
  scrollable on the right (`↑/↓` switch repo, `PgUp/PgDn` scroll). `y` still
  copies the full Markdown digest. Repo grouping/ordering is shared with the
  digest via a new `cohors_core::group_commits`.

## [0.3.4] — 2026-06-14

### Added

- The background now **dims behind a modal overlay** (help, standup, command
  runner, confirm), so the open view stands out and the rest recedes — a
  terminal-friendly stand-in for a blur.

## [0.3.3] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- The footer now groups the key hints into labelled rows — **select** / **act** /
  **view** — with the key in an accent colour and a plain-word description, so
  it reads like a legend (it's clear that, e.g., the "act" keys act on the marked
  repos). Each row wraps independently on a narrow terminal.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- The key-hint **footer** is now a box whose commands **wrap onto more lines on a
  narrow ("compact") terminal**, instead of being truncated on the right.
- **Reverted** the command-run view to the two-pane list + scrollable detail (the
  per-repo boxed column from 0.3.1 wasn't wanted). The mouse-scroll reversal from
  0.3.1 stays.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-06-13

### Changed

- The command-run view now shows **one boxed section per repo** (a `╭─ name · ✓`
  header rule + its output) in a single scrollable column, and the output
  **wraps** so it stays readable in a narrow/compact terminal (was a fixed
  two-pane list + detail that clipped long lines).

### Fixed

- **Reversed the scroll direction.** cohors now captures the mouse and handles
  wheel/trackpad scroll itself (the terminal was translating it to arrow keys),
  so a scroll-up gesture moves the list/content up instead of down.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-13

Bulk actions across the fleet — select repos and act on all of them.

### Added

- **Multi-select**: `Space` marks/unmarks a repo (`a` marks all, `Esc` clears),
  with a `· N selected` count in the header and a `●` gutter on marked rows.
  Marks survive sort/filter/refresh. Actions target the marked set, or the
  current repo when nothing is marked.
- **Command runner** (`!`): run an arbitrary shell command across the selected
  repos concurrently (bounded pool), with a live per-repo status list
  (`✓`/`✗ exit N`), a scrollable per-repo output pane, a combined
  `N ✓ · M ✗` summary, and copy-to-clipboard (`y`).
- **Bulk stash** (`S`) behind a confirmation modal (default No), and **fetch**
  (`f`) / **pull** (`p`) now act on the whole selection.

### Notes

- Bulk *checkout* is served by the command runner (`! git checkout <branch>`)
  rather than a dedicated built-in. Config `groups`/tags are deferred (optional).

## [0.2.2] — 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- The **Remote** indicator was invisible in terminals whose font lacks a text
  glyph for the cloud character (`☁`, U+2601). Replaced it with a colored status
  dot (`●`) — a basic glyph present in every monospace font, colored via ANSI
  like the rest of the UI (green passing, red failing, yellow pending). Follows
  the same monochrome-glyph-plus-color approach Claude Code's TUI uses; emoji are
  avoided because they're double-width and can't be themed or `NO_COLOR`'d.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-06-13

### Changed

- The **Remote** column now shows a single cloud (`☁`) colored by CI health —
  green passing, red failing, yellow pending, dim when there's no signal — with
  the open-PR count beside it, instead of distinct `✓`/`✗`/`●`/`·` glyphs. One
  recognizable icon reads more simply than four.

### Fixed

- Remote (PR/CI) state now **persists**: it's carried across a re-scan instead of
  blanking to "—" until re-enrichment, and it's written to the warm-start cache
  so a relaunch shows it immediately. Previously the column flickered on every
  refresh and never survived a restart.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-13

Remote-aware fleet, a weekly standup, and a full dashboard redesign.

### Added

- **GitHub enrichment** (`cohors-github`): per-repo open-PR count, CI/check
  status, and default branch via the REST API. Token is discovered from
  `gh auth token` or `$GITHUB_TOKEN`; results are cached (5-minute TTL) and
  rate-limit-aware. The local scan paints first and enrichment fills in on a
  background thread, so the network never blocks the dashboard.
- **Remote** column showing CI state and open-PR count (or `—` off-GitHub).
- **Weekly standup** view (`Tab`): a scrollable digest of every commit you
  authored across all repos in a window (today / this week), grouped by repo and
  ordered most-active-first, with per-repo commit counts. Copy it to the
  clipboard as Markdown with `y`; scroll with `↑/↓` · `PgUp/PgDn` · `g/G`.

### Changed

- **Redesigned TUI** for readability: a branded header box (name, version,
  description), titled **Attention** and **Repositories** panels with
  plain-word labels instead of terse glyphs, rounded borders throughout, and
  tightened, header-labelled columns.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-13

Initial release: a local git dashboard that beats `git-scope`.

### Added

- Fast ratatui TUI listing every local git repo, with parallel discovery
  (`gix`, `git2` fallback) behind a pure, WASM-safe core + adapter design.
- Per-repo status: branch, ahead/behind upstream, dirty counts
  (staged/modified/untracked), stash count, and last commit.
- Sort (dirty-first), fuzzy filter, dirty-only toggle, and a help overlay;
  arrow-key navigation with `Home`/`End`.
- Actions on a synchronous loop: fetch, pull (fast-forward only), open in
  `$EDITOR`, open in `lazygit`, copy path, reveal in file manager.
- Attention/health scoring in the core — urgency sort plus aging-unpushed and
  stale-stash detection — surfaced as a fleet triage summary.
- JSON snapshot cache for instant warm start; TOML config with XDG paths;
  `cohors init` and `cohors scan` (JSON) commands.
- Privacy-safe sample-data generator for demos; CI (fmt/clippy/test on
  macOS + Linux, plus a wasm-core build) and a release-on-tag binary workflow.
